I could do this with my eyes closed
I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head
Been gone and facin' horrors that should never be said
The wrath and the grit from the pit of despair
Been takin' every whip and word, I've never been spared
They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say that angels are among us
Lock me up in a maze
Turn out, turn out the lights
I was born, I was raised for this
Turn out, turn out the lights 
Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast
I could do this with my eyes closed
(Turn out, turn out the lights)
